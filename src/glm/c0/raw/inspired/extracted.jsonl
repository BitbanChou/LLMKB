I would have recommended White Christmas, it's a classic and a bit of a tradition in our family, but there are so many to choose from!

It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy.

I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend.\nSystem: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?\nUser: The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action.\nSystem: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?\nUser: I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested.\nUser: The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it!\nSystem: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved.\nUser: Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation.

I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me.\nUser: It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things\nSystem: Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like Super Bad? Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like Annabelle but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. What Lies Beneath, Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called Haunted with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today. I have seen two of the others. I appreciate your advice\nSystem: The second one wasn't as scary. I sure hope you enjoy it.\nUser: Thank you. Hva e a great day\nSystem: You too.

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser: Knives Out was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought.
