I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me.\nUser: It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things\nSystem: Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like Super Bad? Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like Annabelle but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. What Lies Beneath, Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called Haunted with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today.

How are you doing this morning?\nUser: Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations?\nSystem: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?\nUser: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was Knives Out a couple months back. That was pretty funny.\nSystem: I absolutely loved Knives Out. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser: Knives Out was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it...
