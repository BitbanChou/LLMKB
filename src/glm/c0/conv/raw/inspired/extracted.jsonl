I'm a horror and comedy fan myself.\nSystem: I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite?\nUser: That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, Wishmaster and Hellraiser.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror.\nSystem: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know.

I will give you a conversation between a user and you (a recommender system).Here is the conversation:\nSystem: Hello, I'm here to help find you a movie trailer!\nUser: Excellent. I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend.\nSystem: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?\nUser: The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action.\nSystem: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?\nUser: I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: .Your Task: Based on the conversation, you first reply the user and then provide 20 recommendations.Please reply in english.\n\n\u7b54\uff1a", "resp": "Based on the conversation, I understand that the user is looking for a movie that is both comedic and romantic, and has Ryan Reynolds or Dwayne Johnson.

I will give you a conversation between a user and you (a recommender system).Here is the conversation:\nSystem: Hello, I'm here to help find you a movie trailer!\nUser: Excellent. I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend.\nSystem: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?\nUser: The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action.\nSystem: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?\nUser: I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested.\nUser: The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it!\nSystem: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved.\nUser: Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation.

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser: Knives Out was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought.
