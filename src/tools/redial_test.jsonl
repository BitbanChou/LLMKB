First, there's New World, a 2005 film directed by Darren Aronofsky. It's a psychological drama that explores the relationship between a young woman and a man who is part of a cult. It's a thought-provoking film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nSecond, I recommend Edward Scissorhands, a 1990 film directed by Tim Burton. It's a classic tale of a gentle, unconventional man who is misunderstood by society. The film features Johnny Depp in the lead role and is a must-see for anyone who loves Burton's unique style.\n\nI hope you enjoy these recommendations! Let me know if you need any more."}
