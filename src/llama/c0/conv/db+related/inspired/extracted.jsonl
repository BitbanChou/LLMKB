I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested.\nUser: The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it!\nSystem: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved.\nUser: Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately.
