How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing pretty great! See any good movies lately?\nSystem: Yes, I've seen some great ones. What about you?\nUser: I've seen a few that I really liked. What kind of movies are you into? I'm a horror and comedy fan myself.\nSystem: I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite?\nUser: That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, Wishmaster and Hellraiser.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror.\nSystem: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know. I also liked the Halloween series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in\nUser: It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time.\nSystem: Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations.\nUser: Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell.\nSystem: Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's 1984. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that.\nUser: 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Cat's Eye (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. Gerald's Game. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo.\nSystem: That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up. Have you ever watched The Shining?\nUser: *Facepalm* How do I forget The Shining!? I've seen the one with Jack Nickolson in it. Was there a new one? I cause I would watch that in a heartbeat.\nSystem: Yes, you have to check out Doctor Sleep. I watched that in 2019 and it's great. It's Danny All grown up.\nUser: WHAT? Yes. I absolutely have to go and watch that. Stephen, you tricky monkey. Couldn't just name it 'Shining 2' could he? I'm definitely going to have to watch that.\nSystem: .Your Task: Based on the conversation, you first reply the user and then provide 20 recommendations.Please reply in english.", "resp": "I don't know.", "rec_list": [{"movie_name": "I don't know.", "min_edit_distance": 8, "nearest_movie": "Don't Let Go"}], "preference": "", "gt_list": ["Doctor Sleep"], "prev_list": ["Film", "Wishmaster", "Wes Craven", "Documentary film", "The Shining", "The King", "Stephen King", "Comedy", "Television show", "Gerald's Game", "Hahaha", "Action film", "Author", "Stan Lee", "Danny", "Halloween", "Doctor Sleep", "Hellraiser", "Cat's Eye", "Jack"]}

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror.
