What was the last great movie you watched?\nUser: Hello, I just watched Good Boys. So funny\nSystem: Not familiar with that one. Is it a comedy? I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me.\nUser: It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things\nSystem: Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like Super Bad? Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like Annabelle but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. What Lies Beneath, Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called Haunted with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today. I have seen two of the others. I appreciate your advice\nSystem: The second one wasn't as scary. I sure hope you enjoy it.\nUser: Thank you. Hva e a great day\nSystem: You too. Good luck finding scary movies to watch.\nUser: OK. Thank you so much again. I hope I like it\nSystem: I'm sure you will.\nUser: Do you know that werewolf in london movie?\nSystem: I watched that a ton of years ago. Probably back in the 80's. I think it's a little dated now, the special effects I mean. But that was good scary.\nUser: I was trying to think of an older one for my kids to watch with me but you are righ the special effects are prob awful\nSystem: .Your Task: Based on the information and conversation, you reply me with 20 recommendations without extra sentences.Please reply in english.", "resp": "1.

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought.
