Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like  but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. , Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called  with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today. I have seen two of the others. I appreciate your advice\nSystem: The second one wasn't as scary. I sure hope you enjoy it.\nUser: Thank you. Hva e a great day\nSystem: You too.

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest  film, if you're into that.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And  films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately.
