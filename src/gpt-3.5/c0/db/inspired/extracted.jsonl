Star War is coming out this month and that's going to be huge if you're into Sci Fi.\nUser: I'd love to see the new Star Wars but I have to catch up on the old ones first!\nSystem: That's a must. What was the last movie you've recently?\nUser: It was actually return of the jedi last night. I love action films and all the Terminator movies\nSystem: I love those as well. Have you heard about Bad Boys 3 coming out this Jan with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3.\nUser: No I've never heard of that, what's the story line?\nSystem: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy. A hit sequel came out and now after many years a third is going to be released in January.\nUser: Well I better watch the first two before that one comes out!\nSystem: Since you enjoy action films have you heard and seen the fast and furious franchise?\nUser: Yeah I have seen those. I kind of like corny 80's action movies more\nSystem: Say no more. Are you more of a Stallone? Van Damme? or Scharzenegger fan?\nUser: Definitely Schwarzenegger\nSystem: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about.

It is really good and will keep you on you seats edge for the whole movie. but if you are looking to stay in and rent or stream a good movie i would go with terminator dark fury or fast and furious hobbs and shaw. both of these movies are very good and will keep you well entertained .\nUser: I'm definitely interested in the Terminator franchise. I'll go with that pick.\nSystem: You will not regret it ! it has the return of the original Sarah Conner ( well the lady who played her in the very first movie, Linda Hamilton i believe is her name), as well as Arnold as the terminator that has aged thru time who has stayed to make sure things stay on track for the human race and sky net never rises. plus the new terminators are awesome!!! the graphics and effects are next level for sure\nUser: Is her son in this version of the movie as well?
