That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror.\nSystem: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately.
