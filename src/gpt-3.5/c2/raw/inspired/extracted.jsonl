I'm looking for a movie recommendation\nSystem: You're talking to the right guy! What kind of movies are you into? Star War is coming out this month and that's going to be huge if you're into Sci Fi.\nUser: I'd love to see the new  but I have to catch up on the old ones first!\nSystem: That's a must. What was the last movie you've recently?\nUser: It was actually return of the jedi last night. I love action films and all the  movies\nSystem: I love those as well. Have you heard about Bad Boys 3 coming out this Jan with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3.\nUser: No I've never heard of that, what's the story line?\nSystem: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy. A hit sequel came out and now after many years a third is going to be released in January.\nUser: Well I better watch the first two before that one comes out!\nSystem: Since you enjoy action films have you heard and seen the fast and furious franchise?\nUser: Yeah I have seen those. I kind of like corny 80's action movies more\nSystem: Say no more. Are you more of a Stallone? Van Damme? or Scharzenegger fan?\nUser: Definitely Schwarzenegger\nSystem: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit  or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated.\nUser: I've seen both of those!

I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me.\nUser: It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things\nSystem: Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like Super Bad? Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like  but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. , Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called  with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today. I have seen two of the others. I appreciate your advice\nSystem: The second one wasn't as scary. I sure hope you enjoy it.\nUser: Thank you. Hva e a great day\nSystem: You too.

I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest  film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser:  was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And  films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it...
