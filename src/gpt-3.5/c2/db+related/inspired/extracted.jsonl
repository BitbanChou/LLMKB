It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3.\nUser: No I've never heard of that, what's the story line?\nSystem: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life.

How are you doing this morning?\nUser: Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations?\nSystem: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?\nUser: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was  a couple months back. That was pretty funny.\nSystem: I absolutely loved . I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest  film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser:  was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And  films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it...
