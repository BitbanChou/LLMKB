I think there was a sequel that came out a while back, but that's as far as I've gone with this. What recent movies have you seen? Have you seen ? Not sure if that's a horror movie, though. Sure sounds like it.\nUser: I recently watched the new  with michael myers and Anabelle. I haven't seen  but I think its a comedy if im correct. What horror movies would you suggest watching that came out in 2019?\nSystem: Have you seen  Comes Homes? Something about a haunted doll always gives me chills.\nUser: I haven't seen that one, I might check it out.

What's your favorite comedy movie?\nUser: Of all time? I really like Airplane, or anything with Leslie Neilsen.\nSystem: That's an awesome movie, so many great one liner jokes. Leslie had such great comedic timing.\nUser: Yes, he's a classic. I think Will Ferrell is a lot like him. Both have that comedic presense.\nSystem: Would you be interested in watching ?\nUser: I've seen that one, and it's great! I've probably watched it a dozen times.

What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?\nUser: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was  a couple months back. That was pretty funny.\nSystem: I absolutely loved . I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest  film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser:  was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And  films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it...
